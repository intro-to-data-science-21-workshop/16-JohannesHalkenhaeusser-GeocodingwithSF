## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Packages}

library(tidyverse)

#might require install.package("sf")
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(legislatoR)
library(tm)
library(OpenStreetMap)
library(rnaturalearth)

```

```{r}
#Let's say I want to find my home in relationship to Hertie
#I can give OSM my relative address and Hertie's address
Geocoded_Frame <- geocode_OSM(c("Hertie School of Governance, Friedrichstrasse, Berlin, Germany",
                                "Rieslingstrasse, 69514 Laudenbach, Germany"), 
                              as.sf= T,
                              projection = 4326)

#how far away from home am I?
st_distance(Geocoded_Frame$point[1], Geocoded_Frame$point[2])

#get a line feature
line_element <- Geocoded_Frame %>% 
  st_coordinates() %>% 
  sfheaders::sf_linestring()

#we need some real world data
data("World")

# use the plot vs. view argument to make your map interactive
tmap_mode('plot')

#add the layer with the world map
tm_shape(filter(World, iso_a3 == "DEU"))+
  tm_fill() +
  tm_borders() +
  
tm_shape(Geocoded_Frame) + # add the points to the map
  tm_bubbles(col = "red", size = .025) + 
  
tm_shape(line_element) + # add the lines to the map 
  tm_lines()

## This map is not so clear and ad-hoc. Let's work with something more advanced...

```
We will get data that includes spatial information from the legislatoR database.
For our sample run we will use the legislator data base from Austria. 


```{r}
core_aut <- get_core(legislature = 'aut')
pol_aut <- get_political(legislature = 'aut')

head(core_aut)

#the birthplace and deathplace geocodes are not separated out yet. 
#we identify the latitude and longitude 
core_aut <- core_aut %>%
  separate(birthplace, into = c('bp_lat', 'bp_long'), sep = ",") %>%
  separate(deathplace, into = c('dp_lat', 'dp_long'), sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(bp_lat = parse_number(bp_lat)) %>%
  mutate(bp_long = parse_number(bp_long)) %>%
  mutate(dp_lat = parse_number(dp_lat)) %>%
  mutate(dp_long = parse_number(dp_long))

head(core_aut, 3)

```

```{r Translate birthplaces}

#drop NAs in geo data
core_aut_nona <- drop_na(core_aut, any_of(c("bp_long", "bp_lat", "dp_long", "dp_lat")))

# reverse geocode the names of birthplaces.
# But what if we care about the distribution and individual names don't tell us anything. 
#reversed_results <- rev_geocode_OSM(x = core_aut_nona$bp_long,y= core_aut_nona$bp_lat)


```

Let's use a shapefile from the internet with a higher resolution and more in depth information about the district levels. 
```{r Open Austria}

# https://data-synergis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SynerGIS::bezirksgrenzen-1250-000/explore?location=47.092207%2C14.608863%2C7.56

# https://www.infoworld.com/article/3505897/how-to-do-spatial-analysis-in-r-with-sf.html

#

#read in shapefile 
oesterreich <- st_read("data/Bezirke_250.shp")

#first map
qtm(oesterreich)

#figure out the crs key
st_crs(oesterreich)

#get the birthplaces as sf 
birthplaces_geo <- st_as_sf(core_aut_nona, 
                      coords = c(x = "bp_long", y = "bp_lat"), 
                      crs = 4326)

#get the deathplaces as sf 
deathplaces_geo <- st_as_sf(core_aut_nona, 
                      coords = c(x = "dp_long", y = "dp_lat"), 
                      crs = 4326)

geopoints <- cbind(birthplaces_geo, deathplaces_geo)


#join birth and deathplaces with the austria map
results_birthplace <- st_join(birthplaces_geo, oesterreich, join = st_within)
results_deathplace <- st_join(deathplaces_geo, oesterreich, join = st_within)
results_geopoints <- st_join(geopoints, oesterreich, join = st_within)

## How to use tmap 
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html


#draw the austria maps
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(oesterreich) +
  tm_polygons() +
tm_fill(alpha = 1) +
tm_shape(results_birthplace) +
tm_bubbles(col = "red", size = .025)


```
## Get filled polygons
Our map looks good but what if we don't care about the individual legislators but more about the distribution of where most of them were born. (right now we might have overlapping features as we saw in the reverse coded example) 
We can calculate how many legislators are in each of the polygone shapes 
```{r}

#we use the st_intersects
oesterreich_count <-  oesterreich %>% 
  mutate(counts = lengths(st_intersects(., birthplaces_geo)))

tmap_mode("plot") # to make the map interactive use "view"
tm_shape(oesterreich_count) + 
  tm_polygons(col =  "counts",
              n = 5,
              palette = "Reds",
              id = "PB",
              title = "How many points were counted in each region") +
  tm_text("PB", size = "AREA",scale = .5, style = "log10_pretty", remove.overlap = TRUE) 


```
