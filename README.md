# Geocoding with sf


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Session contents
- Short introduction to sf in R and geocoding
- What is geocoding?
- What is sf?
- How do they relate?
- Workshop coding
  - Basic coding example to plot Hertie onto a map
  - Using the legislatoR data to plot some maps and use geo-information contained.


### Main learning objectives
- You should know what sf is
- You should understand what (reverse) geocoding is
- You should come out understanding which few lines of code are needed to plot a map
